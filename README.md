# Goal of the project
The project's main purpose was to do something that had at least some value to the end-user because the main purpose of this project was to upload my first app to the AppStore, I didn't want to just upload a bs app with no value I tried to at least provide something for the end-user.

# What can you do?
Well, you install the app and then you can add a widget to your home screen this widget will provide a quote to help you go through your day. The quotes you get are randomized at default you get a new quote every hour. But the app support extra functionality where you can specify how long it takes for a new quote to appear and also you can customize the color of the widget so it becomes more in line with the vibe in your home screen

## technologies used used 
SwiftUI, WidgetKit, Google Admob.
